# **Conditional Statements in C**  

This folder focuses on **Conditional Statements**, a crucial part of programming that enables decision-making in your code. With these constructs, you can execute different blocks of code based on conditions, making your programs dynamic and interactive.  

---

## ðŸš€**Topics Covered**
1. **If-Else Statements**: Make decisions based on conditions.  
2. **Switch-Case Statements**: Handle multiple cases efficiently with a cleaner syntax.  
3. **Nested Conditions**: Evaluate multiple conditions hierarchically.

|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `if_else.c`            | Demonstrates the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making. |
| `switch_case.c`        | Shows how to use the `switch` statement to handle multiple cases.                   |
| `nested_conditions.c`  | Examples of nested `if` statements to evaluate multiple conditions.                 |

## ðŸŒŸ **Quick Tips**
- Use **`if-else`** for conditions where outcomes are not predefined or vary dynamically.  
- Opt for **`switch-case`** when you need to handle fixed, discrete values (e.g., menu options).  
- Avoid excessive **nesting**, as it can make code harder to read. Break complex conditions into smaller functions if necessary.

## ðŸ›  **How to Run These Programs**
1. Open a terminal or IDE supporting C programming (like GCC, Visual Studio Code, or Code::Blocks).  
2. Compile the program using the following command:  
   ```bash
     gcc program_name.c -o program_name
      ```
