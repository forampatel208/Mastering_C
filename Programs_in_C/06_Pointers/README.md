# Pointers in C

This folder delves into one of the most powerful features of C: **Pointers**. It explores basic operations, pointer arithmetic, and their applications with arrays and functions. Mastering pointers is essential for dynamic memory management and efficient programming.

---

## ðŸš€ **Topics Covered**
1. **Pointer Basics**: Understanding pointers, their syntax, and operations.
2. **Pointer Arithmetic**: Manipulating memory addresses using pointer arithmetic.
3. **Pointers and Arrays**: Accessing and manipulating arrays using pointers.
4. **Pointers and Functions**: Passing pointers to functions for more efficient memory usage.

## ðŸŒŸ **Quick Tips**
- Pointers hold memory addresses and can be used for direct memory manipulation.
- Use `*` for dereferencing a pointer to access or modify the value it points to.
- Arrays and pointers are closely related; array names are pointers to their first elements.
- Passing pointers to functions saves memory and allows direct modification of variables.

## ðŸ›  **How to Run These Programs**
1. Open a terminal or your favorite IDE (like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or GCC).
2. Compile the program using:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
