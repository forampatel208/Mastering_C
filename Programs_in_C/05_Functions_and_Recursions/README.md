# Functions and Recursions

This folder covers key concepts of functions in C, including defining and using functions, passing parameters, recursion, and understanding the scope of variables. These concepts are crucial for writing modular and efficient code.

---

## ðŸš€ **Topics Covered**
1. **Defining Functions**: How to define and use functions for modular programming.
2. **Function Parameters**: Demonstrating passing parameters by value and by reference.
3. **Recursion**: Understanding how recursion works with practical examples like calculating factorials.
4. **Scope of Variables**: Exploring the scope of variables within functions and how it affects the program.

| `function_parameters.c`  | Shows how to pass parameters by value and by reference.              |
| `recursion_example.c`    | A simple recursion example (e.g., calculating factorial).            |
| `scope_of_variables.c`   | Explains variable scope within functions and its importance.         |

## ðŸŒŸ **Quick Tips**
- Functions help break a program into smaller, manageable parts, making the code modular and reusable.
- Passing parameters by reference allows the function to modify the original variables.
- Recursive functions call themselves and are useful for problems that have repetitive sub-problems (like factorials).
- Local variables within functions are not accessible outside their function.

## ðŸ›  **How to Run These Programs**
1. Open a terminal or your favorite IDE (like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or GCC).
2. Compile the program using:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
