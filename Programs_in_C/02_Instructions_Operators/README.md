# **Operators in C**

This folder dives into the world of **Operators in C**, which are essential tools for performing operations on data and controlling the flow of a program. Mastering these concepts will allow you to write effective and optimized C code.

---

## ðŸš€ **Topics Covered**
1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform basic mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.  
2. **Relational Operators**: Compare values to determine their relationships (e.g., equal, greater, less).  
3. **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple conditions or negate them logically.  
4. **Bitwise Operators**: Operate on data at the binary level, enabling low-level programming.  
5. **Assignment Operators**: Simplify expressions by combining operations with assignment.

| Program Name           | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arithmetic_operators.c` | Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`. |
| `relational_operators.c` | Examples of relational comparisons using `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`. |
| `logical_operators.c`    | Shows logical operations using `&&`, `||`, and `!`.              |
| `bitwise_operators.c`    | Introduces bit-level operations like `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`. |
| `assignment_operators.c` | Explains shorthand operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.  |

## ðŸŒŸ **Quick Tips**
- Arithmetic operations follow **precedence rules**; use parentheses `()` to override.  
- Logical and relational operators are commonly used in **if-else statements**.  
- Bitwise operations are powerful but can be tricky; start with small binary values to test them.  
- Assignment operators help simplify code and reduce redundancy.

## ðŸ›  **How to Run These Programs**
1. Open a terminal or IDE supporting C programming (like GCC, Visual Studio Code, or Code::Blocks).  
2. Compile the program using the following command:  
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```  
3. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
