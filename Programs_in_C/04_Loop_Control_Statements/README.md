# Loop Control Statements

This folder demonstrates the different loop control statements in C, including `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and nested loops. Mastering loops is essential for performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

---

## ðŸš€ **Topics Covered**
1. **For Loops**: Introduction to `for` loops and their usage for repeated tasks.
2. **While Loops**: Understanding the basic structure and use of `while` loops.
3. **Do-While Loops**: Demonstrating `do-while` loops where the condition is checked after the execution.
4. **Nested Loops**: Using multiple loops inside each other to create complex patterns.

| `for_loop.c`         | Basic usage of `for` loops for iterating over a sequence.                    |
| `while_loop.c`       | Implementation of a `while` loop to perform repeated actions.                |
| `do_while_loop.c`    | Demonstrates the `do-while` loop with the condition checked after execution. |
| `nested_loops.c`     | Examples of nested loops and pattern generation.                             |

## ðŸŒŸ **Quick Tips**
- Use `for` loops when the number of iterations is known in advance.
- Use `while` loops when the number of iterations is not determined upfront.
- `do-while` loops ensure that the code inside the loop runs at least once, regardless of the condition.
- Be cautious with nested loops as they can significantly increase execution time.

## ðŸ›  **How to Run These Programs**
1. Open a terminal or your favorite IDE (like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or GCC).
2. Compile the program using:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
